## About the code
* Code in this example uses package names like controller, database, repository, service. These names are not mandatory an may be changed.
* The use of english in the code is done for simplicity and may be changed.

## Architecture (simple overview)
* Customer.java: is the main class of this app that runs spring-boot.
* CustomerController.java: acts as a REST endpoint receiver. It uses various service-classes to execute business logic.
* CustomerService.java(Impl): Executes business logic for Customer. Current version uses database to create Customer. 
* InsuranceAgreementService.java(Impl): Executes business logic for InsuranceAgreement. Current version uses database to create and update InsuranceAgreement.
* CustomerRepository.java and InsuranceAgreementRepository.java: responsible for CRUD-operations on DB.
* PostService: Just a mock for now returning OK.
* Most likely, the two former services/entities would be realized as separate (Micro)services.
