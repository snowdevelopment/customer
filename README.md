## Architecture (simple overview)
* Customer.java: is the main class of this app that runs spring-boot.
* CustomerController.java: acts as a REST endpoint receiver. It uses the CustomerService to execute business logic.
* CustomerService.java(Impl): Executes business logic. Current version uses database to create and update CustomerEntity.java and InsuranceAgreementEntity.java. Most likely, the two former entities would be realized as separate (Micro)services.
* CustomerRepository.java and InsuranceAgreementRepository.java: responsible for CRUD-operations on DB.
